# Classifying-Iris-Dataset
This repository contains a machine learning project for classifying Iris flower species using the scikit-learn machine learning library, as well as the pandas and numpy data analysis libraries.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Iris flower dataset, which contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each flower's sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width are included in the dataset.
## Dependencies
<ul>
  <li>Python 3.6 or higher</li>
  <li>NumPy 1.19.2 or higher</li>
  <li>Pandas 1.1.3 or higher</li>
  <li>scikit-learn 0.23.2 or higher</li>
  <li>Jupyter Notebook (optional)</li>
</ul>

## Installation
<ol>
  <li>Clone this repository to your local machine.</li>
  <li>Install the dependencies listed above using pip or conda.</li>
  <li>Open iris_classifier.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook (optional).</li>
</ol>

Alternatively, you can run the Python script version of the notebook by running the following command in your terminal:

python iris_classifier.py

This will train the machine learning model and output the accuracy score.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy to build and train a machine learning model for classifying iris flower species. With the knowledge gained from this project, you can apply these same techniques to build models for classifying other types of data.
